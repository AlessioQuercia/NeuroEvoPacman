# NeuroEvoGame

## Overview

The repository is intended to monitor the progress of the project related to the Intelligent Systems course at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano. 

The project concerns the implementation of PacMan game using neural networks and genetic algorithms. Based on a standard PacMan implementation, the idea is to evolve neural networks associated with PacMan players using a genetic algorithm, NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), and to select the best neural networks (corresponding to the one better playing the game, thus achieving a better score).
